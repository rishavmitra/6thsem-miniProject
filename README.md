# Image Registration with OpenCV and homography
The asset folder contains three biomedical images (2 brain scans and 1 colon).

The file IntensityHistogram.ipynb show the histogram of the brain scans and how they differ from one another.
The main file is named Homography.ipynb, where two images of colon (second image is just a 45 degree rotated copy of the first image) have been registered using Homography. The math behind homograph can be studied from [Click here](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-homography-a-k-a-perspective-transformation-cacaed5ca17).
